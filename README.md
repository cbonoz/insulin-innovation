### Notes
* Integrates with any FHIR or medical record system
* Many apps exist for diabetes, but few are just in time. Glucometers can help, but are more reactive than preventative.
* Food recognition, social data, medical research all power our rules engine that adjusts recommendation dosages for that individual's specific backgorund.
* With insulin.ai, we're looking to empower uses to get more intelligent recommendations for insulin dosages in response *before* a meal.
* Share and track results with clinicians via email or in person.
