### Notes
* Integrates with any FHIR or medical record system
* 71 billion per year in in-patient hospital costs for diabetes
* Insulin the most frequently described drug in hospital and 30% of all presription fatalities are because of insulin mis-dosages
* Many apps exist for diabetes tracking, but few are just in time or provide active recommendations. Glucometers can help gauge dosage, but are more reactive than preventative.
* Food recognition, social data, medical research all power our rules engine that adjusts recommendation dosages for that individual's specific backgorund.
* With insulin.ai, we're looking to empower users to get more intelligent recommendations for insulin dosages in response *before* a meal.
* Share and track results with clinicians via email or in person.
* Pulls data from FHIR/insurance system or uploaded.
